Routing Methods:
    -> Performance Based:
        Designed for endpoints in various geo location. Will redirect to whatever is the closet endpoint for the user based on the network latency.
    -> Waited:
        Designed to distribute trafiic accordingly to the wait sett the  the dev between (1 & 1000). So it can be set evenly if every  end point is of same weight or based of the waits we want to set the traffice.
    -> Geographical:
        Designed to redirect users based on the geo location. One reason for this can be is various compliances(like GDPR, HIPPA,...). So that data will not cross the borders.
    -> Priority:
        Designed to route all the traffic to the priority of the endpoints defined as long as the server is healty. If the server is not healty then the traffic will be routed to the next priority endpoint.
    -> MultiValue:
        Within a sigel query you will gett the list of all the endpoints at the backend, but with this you can not use name server for the mapping you can only use i/p v4/6.
    -> Subnet:
    

We can do  nested endpoints in azure.

Traffic manager profile name has to be globally unique:
    ->  In terms of uniqueness, Traffic Manager profiles must be unique within the same subscription, but they do not need to be unique across all users. This means that you can have multiple Traffic Manager profiles with the same name within the same subscription, as long as they are in different resource groups. However, if you try to create a Traffic Manager profile with a name that is already in use within the same subscription, you will receive an error message.
    So, to summarize, the name of a Traffic Manager profile must be unique within the same subscription, but it does not need to be unique across all users or subscriptions.


Through traffice manager we can add azure endpoitn, external end point, nested end point.
